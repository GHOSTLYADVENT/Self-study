# Project Management Methodologies and terminologies
## Waterfall Cycle 
1. plan
2. build
3. test
4. review
5. deploy

### Notes
Scrum divides the whole project into smaller chunks, based on an agile approach to tackling complex problems

## Scrum Cycle
1. plan
2. build with minimal features
3. test
4. review

### Notes
this method is repeated(iterated) on a weekly basic for a period almost two to four weeks, till the product is ready
1st iteration or sprint, 2nd, 3rd, and so on, each iteration has its strength, software version

## Agile
It's not a methodology or framework or process, agile promotes self-learning and self-organization, by implementing a scientific method that replaces a programmed algorithmic approach, this means not planning the whole project but instead, sprints or iterations to create a ready shipped product by reacting to feedback on each sprint

## 3 Roles in Scrum:
1. product owner
2. scrum master
3. team

## Misconceptions
- Supervisor approach vs agile approach used by scrum master (ordering a queue by making people self-organized through the guidance of scrum master)
- scrum master is not a project manager, both of them use different methodologies in arranging tasks and people
- scrum masters teach people to grow and have harmony while also ensuring productivity 
- self-organization is not the absence of management

## Scrum framework:
- implement a scientific method of empiricism 

## 3 pillars of empiricism :
1. fact-based
2. experience-based
3. evidence-based

### Notes
all of them are based on reality, not planning entirely

## Scrum Lifecycle
- product owner
- product backlog- release backlog - sprint  backlog - backlog  items
- user stories ->insight <- retrospective <- Demo of potential release

### Notes
after every sprint, implement user stories that became tasks after integrating the code into the system after holding daily scrums, there will be a sprint review and then presented to the customer for acceptance and then the team conducts a sprint retrospective to see if there are any improvement to be made and then the status gets updated

## Agile methodologies:
1. scrum
2. kanban
3. xp
4. hybrid
5. FDD
6. crystal

## Product Backlog
- the ordered list of tasks and requirements the final products need
- it's constantly evolving due to changes being made and the product owner talks with the dev team to apply any new reviews or opinions
- done by the product owner

## Sprint Backlog
- the list of items that needed to be worked on during a sprint, team members sign up for tasks in the sprint backlog based on their skills and priorities
- the product owner and scrum master(daily scrum) conduct a sprint planning to create a sprint backlog

## Burndown Charts
- a graphical representation of the amount of estimated remaining work

## Product Increments
- a sum of work completed in a sprint combined with previous work done in previous sprints

### Notes
create a sprint review conducted by the product owner (stockholders and scrums masters attend) while the developer's team show what they have completed since the last sprint


## Ceremonies in Scrum are :
1. sprint planning
2. daily scrum
3. sprint review
4. sprint retrospective

## Kanban
- in Japanese means billboard, developed by Toyota for manufacturing 

## Kanban Cycle
1. Backlog
2. todo
3. in progress
4. completed


## Differences between kanban and scrum
- in scheduling, iteration, and cadence
- fixed roles in scrum unlike Kanban, commitment is optional for teams in Kanban(free to deliver more or less according to the needs)
- obstacles are immediately dealt with in scrum but in Kanban are dealt with in later times
- Scrum, creates cross-functional teams, Kanban has specialized teams, scrum encourages team collaboration to complete the task, and Kanban strives to achieve goals
- scrum can't add during ongoing iterations while Kanban is more iterative due to a lack of timeframes
- Scrum, sprint backlog is owned by only one time, in Kanban, multiple teams can do this
