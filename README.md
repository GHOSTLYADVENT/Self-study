<li>Triadic (Equally distant on wheel - 3 colors) (Hard to pull off) (Best for cartoon scenes) </li>
<li>Complementary (Opposing colors on wheel - 2 colors) (Very popular) (Naturally pleasing to eye) (Use one color predominantly over the other one)</li>
<li>Split Complementary (Opposing colors on wheel and divide it into two so 3 colors used) (More creative freedom) (Lively vibes) </li>
<li>Tetratic - Double Complementary (two pairs of Opposing colors) (Best used for foreground/backgrouund) (Never use 25% of each) (Hard bu pleasing) </li>
