# Software Architecture Introduction

### Steps to do
1. Context (How the system should behave)

- software architecture
- functional requirement
- non-functional requirements (utilities, reliability, efficiency, and usability)
- (Developed for years =s maintainability)
- (Able to serve millions of users = scalability)
- (Available 24/7  = Reliability)
- (Short response time = efficiency )
- Restrictions (Legal Compliance, standards, cost, time to market)

<hr>
2. Prioritize (some requirements may interfere)

- time to market vs features
<hr>
3. Design the system

- one thing at a time(Over engineer)
- (YAGNI  you ain't gonna need it)
